      Minimal patient identifiers from UniSoft GIReport Database.


    # Only available in dbt-core>=1.6
    # constraints:
    #   - type: primary_key
    #     columns: person_source_value

    columns:
      - name: person_source_value
        description: |
          `Combo ID` is the unique patient identifier within this database but may represent more than one patient.
          This becomes `person_source_value` at the source layer which will be replaced by the
          Flex `patient_id`/`person_source_value` in later layers.
        tests:
          - not_null
          - unique

      - name: nhs_number
        description: |
          NHS Number in GIReport is stored as `nvarchar` and is converted to `numeric` in this step.
          Values failing conversion are stored as `null`.
        # todo:
        # tests: check if nhs_number is valid.
