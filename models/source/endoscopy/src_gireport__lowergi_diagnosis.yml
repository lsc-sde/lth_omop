    description: |
      Diagnoses from Lower GI endoscopy that are stored as boolean values in source.
      There are additional models for specific diagnostic groups such as perianal lesions.
    columns:
      - name: person_source_value
        description: |
          `Combo ID` is the unique patient identifier within this database but may represent more than one patient.
          In tables other than the `Patient` table, this column is called 'Patient No'.
          This becomes `person_source_value` at the source layer which will be replaced by the
          Flex `patient_id`/`person_source_value` in later layers.
        tests:
          - not_null

      - name: visit_occurrence_id
        description: |
          This is the unique identifier for each endoscopy episode `[Episode No]`.
          Each episode may have one or more procedures associated with it.
        tests:
          - not_null

      - name: condition_source_value
        description: |
          The values in this column are obtained by performing an 'UNPIVOT' on a wide table in source.
          This results in loss of some information that is stored in non-boolean fields.
          These other fields are loaded separately.
        tests:
          - not_null
